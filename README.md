Our webpage will be about a delivery app. The app acts like a middleman for 2 parties, one who provides the good and the other being the reciever. After the provider inputs the reciever's address, a rider will pick up the goods from the provider and deliver it to the reciever. 
In the webpage, there will be buttons to show delivery status, create a delivery order and register as a provider. Included will be a log in page, like any other webpage that uses personal infomation.
