# Design process 
Our webpage will be about a delivery app. The app acts like a middleman for 2 parties, one who provides the good and the other being the reciever.
There are 2 categories to a user, a delivery person and a receiver of parcels.
As a delivery person, the app is suppose to assist me in telling where to collect the parcel, and where to deliver the parcel.
As a receiver, the app will inform me on the status of the parcel. 

# Features 
# Existing features 
Feature 1 - weather API to show users how the weather is today.
Feature 2 - A live date creator to show user what the date is today.
Feature 3 - Log in page that does not work yet, it is just a concept.

#Features left to implement
- Have the weather API mean something(when the forecast is 'Raining', there will be a text that inform receivers that their parcel delivery time might be longer)
- Functioning log in page if possible
